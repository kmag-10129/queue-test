Notes:
- Programmed in Visual Studio 2022
- There is no actual executable part attached to this program. **All functionality is called using the test script.**
- Queue functionality is implemented using a **vector** object type. This allows for a queue that can dynamically change size, a feature that I believe is more useful for queues in the more "general" definition.

How to use:
- Clone this repository into a folder
- Open the "Queue.sln" file using Visual Studio.
- In the "Tests" tab, open "Test Explorer".
- Run each test category. *Note that running ALL tests at once will cause some test cases to fail due to test definitions.*
